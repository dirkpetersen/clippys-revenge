# Security model

Clippy's Revenge gives an AI tool access to your mail, so it is built to do as
little as possible and to keep that access on your PC.

## What it never does

- **Never sends email.** Drafts are only saved. You send them from Outlook. The
  one exception is a [meeting invite](calendar.md#meeting-invites), which is sent
  only after you click **Send** in a confirmation dialog.
- **Never deletes or moves email.** The only move is putting a reply draft it just
  created into Drafts. Retention and reconcile remove rows from Clippy's own index
  only, never from your mailbox.
- **Never starts Outlook** on its own. It attaches to a running Outlook. The
  tray's **Start Outlook** item, which you click yourself, is the only exception.
- **Never uses the cloud.** No Microsoft Graph, no Entra app registrations, no
  OAuth. Nothing leaves your PC except what Claude Code itself sends to its model.
- **Never indexes attachment contents.** Only file names.

## Network

- **Localhost only.** The server binds to `127.0.0.1` and nothing else. Other
  computers on your network can't reach it. It does not bind to the WSL virtual
  adapter either, which is why [WSL needs mirrored networking](connect.md#from-wsl).
- **Bearer token.** Every request must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. The
  comparison is constant-time. Requests without a valid token get an empty `401`.
- **Token storage.** The token is stored encrypted with Windows DPAPI for your
  Windows user, in `%APPDATA%\ClippysRevenge\token.bin`. It is never written to
  `settings.json` or to logs. Regenerate it any time from the tray.
- **Browsers are blocked.** Any request with an `Origin` header gets a `401`, so a
  web page can't call the server, even from your own PC.
- **No OAuth prompts.** The `401` carries no `WWW-Authenticate` header, so MCP
  clients don't start an OAuth flow.

## File access

Every file path a tool reads or writes goes through a path policy. A path must
be inside an allowed folder:

- the attachment folder, `%USERPROFILE%\Downloads\Clippy's Revenge` by default,
  which is always allowed
- `%USERPROFILE%\Documents`
- any folders you add in Settings, General

Paths with `..`, UNC paths, `\\?\` paths, alternate data streams and junction
escapes are refused. This stops a prompt-injected email from making Claude write
into places like the Startup folder, or read files such as `~/.ssh`. A refused path
is shown as `Blocked` in the Activity window.

## Index at rest

The index holds message bodies as plain text, like Outlook's own cache (OST) file.
It is protected by your Windows profile's file permissions and by your disk
encryption. There is no extra encryption layer.

!!! warning "Turn on BitLocker"
    Without full-disk encryption, anyone with your disk can read the index.

## Prompt injection

Email is untrusted text, and Claude reads it. Clippy limits what a malicious email
could make Claude do: it can't send mail, can't delete mail, can only write files to
allowed folders, and every meeting invite needs your click. Still, check drafts
before you send them, and read the invite dialog before you click **Send**.

## Logs

Logs are in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\ClippysRevenge\logs` and kept for 7 days. They contain
tool names, counts and errors. The token is redacted, and mail bodies and search
text are not logged. Activity events show subjects and counts only.

## Unsigned executable

The release exe is not code-signed yet. The installer checks its SHA-256 against
`SHA256SUMS.txt` from the same release before installing.
